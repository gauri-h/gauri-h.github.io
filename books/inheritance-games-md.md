## Synopsis

Avery Grambs has a plan for a better future: survive high school, win a scholarship, and get out. But her fortunes change in an instant when billionaire Tobias Hawthorne dies and leaves Avery virtually his entire fortune. The catch? Avery has no idea why -- or even who Tobias Hawthorne is.

To receive her inheritance, Avery must move into sprawling, secret passage-filled Hawthorne House, where every room bears the old man's touch -- and his love of puzzles, riddles, and codes. Unfortunately for Avery, Hawthorne House is also occupied by the family that Tobias Hawthorne just dispossessed. This includes the four Hawthorne grandsons: dangerous, magnetic, brilliant boys who grew up with every expectation that one day, they would inherit billions.

Heir apparent Grayson Hawthorne is convinced that Avery must be a conwoman, and he's determined to take her down. His brother, Jameson, views her as their grandfather's last hurrah: a twisted riddle, a puzzle to be solved. Caught in a world of wealth and privilege, with danger around every turn, Avery will have to play the game herself just to survive.

## Why I Love This Book

The Inheritance Games is more than just a mystery novel; it's an intricate puzzle box that keeps you guessing until the very end. Here's why I absolutely love this book:

1. **The Puzzles:** The book is filled with riddles and clues that make you feel like you're solving the mystery alongside Avery.

2. **The Characters:** Each character feels fully developed with their own motivations, secrets, and personalities. The four Hawthorne brothers (Grayson, Jameson, Nash, and Xander) are all incredibly different but equally fascinating.

3. **The Setting:** Hawthorne House is like a character itself, with secret passages, hidden rooms, and mysteries around every corner.

4. **The Writing:** Jennifer Lynn Barnes has a way of writing that keeps you turning pages well into the night. The pacing is perfect - never too slow or too rushed.

5. **The Plot Twists:** Just when you think you've figured it out, another twist changes everything you thought you knew!
